In the age of pixels, where ego reigns,
A solipsist's haven, a digital domain.
With whispers of likes and illusory fame,
We've crafted a world, where none bear the blame.

An endless abyss, where voices take flight,
Yet deaf to the chorus, each lost in the night.
We all stand alone, in the digital sphere,
But solipsists ponder, is anyone here?

For if I'm the center, and all else a dream,
Does "social" hold meaning, or so it would seem?
Can a heart's true connection pierce through the screen,
Or is love just a ghost, in a solipsist's scheme?

But hark, a new dawn, a chance to rewrite,
The narrative spun, in this age of byte.
Let's shatter the glass, tear down the divide,
And embrace one another, with hearts open wide.

For the solipsist's journey, though tempting to some,
In the end, leaves us hollow, as connections succumb.
In this age of social, let us not fall prey,
To the solipsist's mindset, in a world led astray.
